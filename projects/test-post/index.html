I couldn't have asked for a better group of individuals to work with.</p> <p>The event, Society of News Design Digital Bootcamp, was a two day course designed to introduce the fundamentals of mobile-first development to journalists.</p> <p>This is the second time I have had the opportunity of teaching along side Chirs Courtney - <a href="//www.twitter.com/@designhawg">@designhawg</a> - at a SND Bootcamp.</p> <p>One of the best things about teaching at these bootcamps is the people you meet. Having worked in the field of journalism for a few years before leaving for the tech industry, I cherish every opportunity I get to surround myself with talented reporters and designers from the industry.</p> <blockquote class=lead-quote>&ldquo;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not.&rdquo; <cite>— Ira Glass</cite> </blockquote> <p>After the first session on Friday, one of the attendees invited Chris and I out for a few drinks at a new brewery on campus - Logboat. Being a craft beer fan, I clearly didn't turn the invite down.</p> <p>In between rounds and before we ate more chili cheese fries than I care to admit, the student asked me a great question. She said, "Why do you do this? Do they pay you that well to come here and teach?"</p> <p>My response, "I don't even know if I am getting paid."</p> <p>The truth, I told her, is that it took a good friend and even better mentor to get me to where I am today. I couldn't be more thankful for all the help Joey Kirk - <a href="//twitter.com/joeykirk">@joeykirk</a> has given me over the years. Had it not been for him, I wouldn't be able to get up in front of those students and talk about HTML or CSS.</p> <p>I know what you are thinking right now, "OK, so the rest of this post is a thank you letter." Nope. That's not what this is at all.</p> <p>This post is the first I've made in years. I stopped blogging the day I left journalism, but that's changing today.</p> <p>Over the last few weeks I have been redesigning and refactoring my personal website. Using the new tools I have learned over the past year, my personal site is now hosted through Github Pages and built with Jekyll, SCSS and Bower.</p> <p>By using Jekyll I gave myself the ability to create a simple, light-weight blog.</p> <p>It is my intent to use this blog to share what I have learned over the years. Ask questions and be challeneged by my peers and those looking to get into the tech industry.</p> <p>This blog will focus on what I know. User-centered design, user interface design and clean/semantic markup. I hope that you are as excited about this as I am.</p> <p>If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please reach out to me on twitter or email me at kurt@launchpadlab.com.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
